    "Consider the following sentence: *A square is breezy if, and only if, there is a pit in one of the directly adjacent squares.* For the square $(0, 0)$ we can express it in the propositional logic as $breezy_{0,0} \\leftrightarrow (pit_{1,0} \\lor pit_{0,1})$.\n",
    "This, of course, is not a Horn clause and therefore cannot be added to our knowledge base. However, not all is lost! Observe that $p\\leftrightarrow q$ is equivalent to $(p\\to q) \\land (q\\to p)$ (in other words: *p if, and only if, q* is equivalent to *if p then q and if q then p*). We can thus rewrite the biconditional as two implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $(pit_{1,0} \\lor pit_{0,1}) \\to breezy_{0,0}$\n",
    "2. $breezy_{0,0} \\to (pit_{1,0} \\lor pit_{0,1})$\n",

    "\n",
    "Now lets look on the other one: $breezy_{0,0} \\to (pit_{1,0} \\lor pit_{0,1})$. Here, we can apply another trick. Consider reading of this implication: *If a square is breezy, then there is a pit in one of the directly adjacent squares*. We can easily write its contrapositive: *If there isn't a pit in one of the directly adjacent squares, then a square isn't breezy.*. In the propositional logic it becomes: $\\lnot(pit_{1,0} \\lor pit_{0,1}) \\to \\lnot breezy_{0,0}$.\n",
    "Following with the De Morgan's law we arrive at: $\\lnot pit_{1,0} \\land \\lnot pit_{0,1} \\to \\lnot breezy_{0,0}$ which... still isn't a Horn clause!\n",
    "But we've got another trick up the sleeve: we will call any square that does not contain a pit a flat square, and any square that is not breezy a windless square.\n",
    "Thus the implication finaly becomes a Horn clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "5. $flat_{1,0} \\land flat_{0,1} \\to windless_{0,0}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Splendid! But there's still one more thing to handle: currently, a single square can contain a pit and be flat at the same time.\n",
    "To handle this, we introduce a special symbol *inconsistent* which can be inferred only if two variables that are known to be inverses of each other can be proven to be both true at the same time:\n",
    "\n",
    "6. $pit_{1,0} \\land flat_{1,0} \\to inconsistent$\n",
    "7. $breezy_{1,0} \\land windless_{1,0} \\to inconsistent$\n",
