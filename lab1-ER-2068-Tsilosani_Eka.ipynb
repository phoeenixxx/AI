    "* *States*: A state description specifies the location of each of the eight tiles and the blank in one of the nine squares.\n",
    "* *Initial state*: Any state can be designated as the initial state. Note that any given goal can be reached from exactly half of the possible initial states.\n",
    "* *Actions*: The simplest formulation defines the actions as movements of the blank space Left, Right, Up, or Down. Different subsets of these are possible depending on where the blank is.\n",
    "* *Transition model*: Given a state and action, this returns the resulting state; for example, if we apply Left to the start state in the figure, the resulting state has the 5 and the blank switched.\n",
    "* *Goal test*: This checks whether the state matches the goal configuration shown in the figure. (Other goal configurations are possible.)\n",
