    "* *Two players* is pretty straightforward: there are exactly two players. Any less is a puzzle (see previous classes), any more is interesting (but out of scope).\n",
    "* *Zero sum* means that a win of one player is necessarly a loss of the other player. For example, if one player wins the game having 100 points, the other player must have exactly -100 points.\n",
    "* *Perfect information* means that there are no hidden variables in the game, like some cards kept in secret by players. Both players can see exactly the same thing.\n",
    "* *Deterministic* means that there is no randomness in the game, no dices, no decks of cards, etc.\n",

    "We begin by defining a general class `Game`, equipped with 7 functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `initial_state` returns a representation of an intial state of the game, e.g., an empty board and an information which player plays first. State is opaque to search algorithms, similarly as in the classes on Agents and A*.\n",
    "* `player` return the id of a player to make a move in the given `state`. Here we consistently use number 1 to represent the first player and 2 to represent the second player, but in general any two distict identifiers would suffice.\n",
    "* `actions` returns a list of valid moves in the given state. This corresponds to the list of available actions in previous classes.\n",
    "* `result` returns a new state after performing the given `action` in the given `state`. This is the transition model underpinning the game.\n",
    "* `is_terminal` returns `True` if the given `state` is a terminal node in the search tree, i.e., either one of the players won or it is a draw. This is a leaf in a search tree and no further actions can be executed.\n",
    "* `utility` can be called only for a terminal `state` and returns a numeric representation of how good this state is for the given `player`. Because we are considering zero-sum games it is always true that `utility(state, 1) = -utility(state, 2)`\n",
    "* `print_state` is a helper function to pretty-print the given `state` to the standard output. As the representation is opaque and possibly hard to read for a human, this little function will make our lives much easier further down the line."

Copy the next two cell a few times, and consider different depths for `HeuristicAlphaBeta`. Keep in mind that the game may be slightly unfair and thus you should always allow every player play in both positions before making conclusions. Afterwards, answer the question below the code cells."

The shallow search (Depth 1) was extremely fast (milliseconds) but played suboptimally and lost to the complete alpha-beta. As I increased the depth, the execution time increased, and the heuristic agent's gameplay improved. The complete alpha-beta is theoretically always better or equal in terms of move quality because it guarantees optimality. However, the heuristic variant becomes equally good when the depth parameter is large enough to see the end of the game. This is because once the search depth exceeds the number of remaining turns, the algorithm reaches the actual terminal states and uses the true utility values (win/loss) rather than the estimated heuristic values, making it mathematically identical to the complete alpha-beta.*"

When matching a shallow search (Depth 1) against a deeper search (Depth 3), the deeper agent consistently won, demonstrating that looking further ahead allows the AI to avoid traps and secure better positions. When two agents played with equal depths (e.g., Depth 2 vs. Depth 2), the first player typically won, illustrating the significant first-mover advantage inherent in the game of Migration where occupying the center early is critical. Finally, the results were consistent across multiple executions. Since both the game rules and my agent's decision-making logic are deterministic, the same match-up always produces the exact same sequence of moves and the same winner.*"
